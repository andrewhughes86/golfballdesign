## Project Task List

## Known bugs
- [X] 'Selected dimple'. Needs a filter to not select the ball. This currently is causing errors in the console.
- [ ] Changing dimple radius occasionally breaks the sketch.

## ToDo
- [ ] Flower Array button (Arrays around another dimple)
- [ ] Look into adding coordinate system to dimples to allow arrarys and possible linking dimples together
- [ ] Dock widget into the correct panel
- [ ] Possibly add ball diameter textbox
- [ ] Guide lines (circles around the ball) to aid with design
- [ ] Create max and min control for dimension to prevent system errors.
- [ ] Add keyboard shortcut instructions.
- [ ] Change polar array function to have a global setting and a way to override it for indivisiual dimples
- [ ] Add dual radius dimple capability
