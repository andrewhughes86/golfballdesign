A specialized FreeCAD workbench designed to simplify and enhance the process designing golf balls. This project is in early development and I do not recomend installing at this time.

## Installation

### Automatic Installation
**Note: This is the recommended way to install this workbench.**  
Once installed all that is needed is to restart FreeCAD and the workbench will be available in the [workbench dropdown list](https://freecadweb.org/wiki/Std_Workbench) menu.

### Manual Installation

```bash
cd ~/FreeCAD/Mod/ 
git clone https://github.com/chbergmann/GolfBallDesign.git
```
When you restart FreeCAD, "Python Workbench Template" workbench should now show up in the [workbench dropdown list](https://freecadweb.org/wiki/Std_Workbench).
